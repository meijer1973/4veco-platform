## Exact post-merge verification

`gh run view 33963305398 --repo meijer1973/4veco-platform --json status,conclusion,headSha`
returned completed/success for 96416b6b5bd57094576e9aba0a42d682584ec479.
The existing lane process completed exit0 with phase merged, no integration
descendants, valid unchanged payload lineage and exact post-merge CI success.
Run: https://github.com/meijer1973/4veco-platform/actions/runs/33963305398.

`node build-scripts/sprints/check-sprint-plan.js reports/sprints/BOOK2-TEXTBOOK-PRODUCTION-1-plan.md`
passed exit0. Independent planning review round 1 requested two narrow
corrections; round 2 passed after both were implemented. No content authoring
had begun at that gate. Repeat plan validation and diff check passed exit0.

Fresh fetch and governance freshness again passed against main96416b6b.
Approved chapter_planning for chapter 2.1 passed exit0. Approved
paragraph_production for 2.1.1 and durable target authority checks passed exit0.

The QC freshness quick-check found the official 2026 framework has superseded
the local protected 2025 reference. Source:

No protected reference was modified or falsely reverified. Optional Inspectie
mapping/current-compliance claims are omitted; external-reference refresh is
named follow-up. All product reviews remain mandatory.

## Reviewed foundation plans and two scoped hold releases

Lesson chapter21 plan commit7ad5dd19e1714bb68d48a55a11a032942a6615e4 passed
independent round2 after exact plan paths and the bounded213→214 profit-change
bridge were added. Root and chapter23 plans passed independent round1 and were
published in lesson9a428e3d15be2ff8931b5a6d859051599aa663a8. Exact reviewed
hashes and findings were published in platform77288fcbf6eddd58779052b66c97227076e1fcd9.
Both production branches were pushed successfully, not merged.

Only H-BOOK2-ROOT-PLAN and H-CHAPTER-23-PLAN were then released locally through
their existing repair actions, actual codex-root actor/date and the immutable
published review references. The canonical projection was regenerated using
the existing formatHoldProjectionRow function and applied only to those rows.

- Approved paragraph_production for211 and231: PASS exit0 after release.
- Durable frozen target/lifecycle authority: PASS exit0, exact12records.
- Semantic outline hash: unchanged919c39f64dd212dba37b62902a5bb2e2ce6388c6020a0491e1621017ae2192a1.
- test:book-outline-currentness:94tests PASS, suite exit0.
- Deliberate negative probes paragraph_production221 and whole_book_assembly:
  FAIL as required, exactly H-221-PRIOR and H-22-ELASTIC-CONTRAST still block.
- H-213-OPC2 remains open; historical approval and audit snapshot unchanged.

## Shared Book2 print tooling checks (pre-product)

Python unittest test_print_pipeline.py:10tests PASS exit0, including temporary
real Pandoc/WeasyPrint PDF + Poppler page/contact-sheet generation. This is a
technical fixture, not a student artifact or visual acceptance. Proof manifest
correctly stays PENDING with no inspected pages or invented zero-defect claim.
Supported WeasyPrint68.1 emitted its known default_url_fetcher deprecation
warning for future69.0; no remote resources are used and no upgrade performed.

Lane-scope focused Jest:24tests PASS exit0. Exact Book2 root/chapter/paragraph
planning filenames are now recognized; wrong IDs, outside-book paths, ZIPs and
companion ownership remain rejected. No broad exception was added.
